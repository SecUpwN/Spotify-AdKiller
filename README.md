# Spotify-AdKiller (for LINUX)

Your Party with [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) - without ads!

[![Spotify-AdKiller](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Spotify-AdKiller/raw/master/Spotify-AdKiller.png)](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Spotify-AdKiller)

We all love Spotify, but sometimes people (like us) want to throw a party without having to listen to interrupting ads before having bought [Spotify Premium](https://www.spotify.com/premium/). Well, with this killer project, now you can!

**This is for testing purposes ONLY!** Spotify is a fantastic service and worth every penny. This script is **NOT** meant to circumvent buying premium! Please do consider switching to premium to support Spotify - especially if you're going to use it on mobile. If the script does not work for you, help us improve it!

### Installation

**Automated Installation**

Grab the latest release of `Spotify-AdKiller`:

    git clone https://github.com/SecUpwN/Spotify-AdKiller.git

Run the provided installer:

    cd Spotify-AdKiller
    ./install.sh

**Troubleshooting**

- `Spotify-AdKiller` has been tested to work with Spotify 0.9.x. Support for the 1.0.x beta releases has been implemented, but still needs more testing. If you run into any bugs while using `Spotify-AdKiller` with a Spotify beta release please report them on the bug tracker.

- If you've installed Spotify from any source other than the official repository please make sure that the `spotify` executable is in your `PATH`.

    You can create a symbolic link, if necessary (e.g. linking `my-spotify` to `spotify` if you are using the user installation of [spotify-make](https://github.com/leamas/spotify-make)).

- The installer script will install `Spotify-AdKiller` to `$HOME/bin`, which should be recognized by Ubuntu and openSUSE.

- If `$HOME/bin` didn't exist before, a relog might be necessary to complete the installation.

    Technical explanation: Ubuntu automatically adds `$HOME/bin` to your `PATH` if it exists when you log in. Relogging reloads `$HOME/.profile` and updates your `PATH`.

    If the script doesn't work after relogging you can either [manually add](http://askubuntu.com/q/3744) `$HOME/bin` to your `PATH` or follow the installation instructions below. This also applies if you're using a distro that is configured differently than Ubuntu/OpenSUSE or if you want to install the script in a custom location.

- If GUI and text are too small, you can scale the application by editing the desktop file:

        cd /home/<your username>/.local/share/applications
        sudo gedit Spotify\ \(AdKiller\).desktop

    Add `--force-device-scale-factor=2` to scale it with factor 2:

        Exec=spotify-wrapper.sh --force-device-scale-factor=2 %U

**Manual Installation**

1. Copy `spotify-adkiller.sh` and `spotify-wrapper.sh` to your `PATH` (e.g. `$HOME/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` on openSUSE and Ubuntu) and make both of them executable with `chmod +x spotify-adkiller.sh` and `chmod +x spotify-wrapper.sh`.

2. Copy `Spotify (AdKiller).desktop` to `$HOME/.local/share/applications` or any other folder your distro reads `.desktop` launchers from (e.g. `/usr/share/applications`, `/usr/local/share/applications`).

The default configuration file will be written automatically on the first startup of the script.

### Usage

If you installed `Spotify-AdKiller` correctly, a new entry called `Spotify (AdKiller)` should appear in your menu. This launcher will start Spotify in ad-free mode. The script will terminate automatically as soon as Spotify exits. As mentioned before, **this is for testing purposes ONLY** so use this new entry only when your purposes are **testing**.

**Important note:** Please make sure you don't have notifications disabled in your Spotify configuration (`ui.track_notifications_enabled=true` in `~/.config/spotify/User/<your username>/prefs`).

### Settings

The configuration file for `Spotify-AdKiller` is located under `$HOME/.config/Spotify-AdKiller/Spotify-AdKiller.cfg`. There are several settings that control how `Spotify-AdKiller` operates:

**Modes**

`CUSTOM_MODE` controls the ad blocking mode. The following modes are available:

- `restart`: close Spotify, restart, minimize, and "press play"
- `simple`: mute Spotify, unmute when ad is over
- `interstitial`: mute Spotify, play random local track, stop and unmute when ad is over
    + If the local track is shorter than the ad, `Spotify-AdKiller` will automatically try to loop it. This will only work with players that support a loop option. If you are planning to use this feature with a custom player make sure to also supply a custom loop option in your configuration file.
- `continuous`: mute Spotify, play random local track, stop and unmute when track is over
    + You can skip the local track as soon as the ad is over. To do so, simply press Play or Forward/Next in your Spotify client (or use the corresponding hotkeys).
    + Please note that the `continuous` ad blocking mode works best with tracks that are longer than the average ad duration (â‰ˆ30-45s). If a custom track ends prematurely or is shorter than the current ad, `Spotify-AdKiller` will switch to the next random local track in line.

The default ad blocking mode is `continuous`.

`Spotify-AdKiller` will always fall back to `simple` mode if no local tracks are found and/or if no supported music player is available on the system.

**Local Playback**

The following settings control local music playback during ads:

- `CUSTOM_PLAYER`: local music player to use; chosen automatically by default
- `CUSTOM_LOOPOPT`: loop option for custom player (e.g. `-loop 0`); we recommend setting this if you are planning to use interstitial adblocking mode
- `CUSTOM_VOLUME`: volume of local playback; set to 100 by default
- `CUSTOM_MUSIC`: local track to play / local music directory to choose tracks from; set to XDG standard music directory by default (e.g. `$HOME/Music`)

**Debug Setting**

You can make the CLI output more verbose and enable the log file by setting `DEBUG` to `1`. The log will be written to `$HOME/.Spotify-AdKiller.log` and replaced each time `Spotify-AdKiller` runs.

### Important Notes

Please make sure to always use the provided launcher when running Spotify. Under some circumstances Spotify might remain muted when exiting the application. This is a technical limitation with `PulseAudio`. `Spotify-AdKiller` automatically unmutes Spotify when initially run.

If, for some reason, Spotify does remain muted you can use the following command to unmute it manually while it's running:

```bash
for i in $(LC_ALL=C pactl list | grep -E '(^Sink Input)|(media.name = \"Spotify\"$)' | cut -d \# -f2 | grep -v Spotify); do pactl set-sink-input-mute "$i" no; done
```
